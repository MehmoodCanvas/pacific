                    <p class="desc">If it can be stitched, molded, printed, or patented, chances are Rich Soergel has already done it — probably twice, and with better colors.</p>
                    <p class="desc">Back in 1984, Rich bought a small design studio called Morris Designs, armed with nothing more than determination, creativity, and a coffee-fueled dream. A year later, he transformed it into Pacific Sportswear & Emblem Company — the spark that would ignite nearly four decades of innovation, design, and laughter (because anyone who’s worked with Rich knows there’s always some laughter).</p>

                    <p class="desc">Rich’s big break came with the America’s Cup, where he produced official headwear and emblems for some of the most elite teams on the water. Those early projects were crafted the old-school way — by hand, with precision, pride, and maybe a few late nights fueled by bad pizza and good ideas.</p>
                    <p class="desc">The results spoke for themselves: Pacific Sportswear was suddenly on the global stage, and Rich learned that a good patch can make waves — literally.</p>

                    <p class="desc">By the ’90s, Rich’s creative gears were spinning faster than a six-head embroidery machine. He patented two original inventions: the Magic Cap and the Tassel Cap, proving that headwear could be both functional and fun.</p>
                    <p class="desc">That’s also when a client jokingly called him “Dr. Patch.” It was meant as a compliment — and it stuck like Velcro. From then on, Dr. Patch became the man who could “diagnose your brand problem and prescribe the perfect patch.” Catchy, accurate, and a whole lot easier to remember than “President and Head of Product Development, Pacific Sportswear & Emblem Co.”</p>

                    <p class="desc">Rich has always believed that patches are more than decoration — they’re badges of belonging, stories you can wear.</p>
                    <p class="desc">After 9/11, he and his team created firefighter and first-responder patches that raised money for the families of fallen heroes. When Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, he designed fundraising patches to help rebuild communities.</p>
                    <p class="desc">And in 2023, after the Maui wildfires, Rich led the “Maui Strong” initiative — crafting limited-edition patches whose proceeds went directly to help displaced families.</p>
                    <p class="desc">Each time tragedy struck, Rich responded the best way he knew how: with needle, thread, and heart.</p>

The result: SmartPatch®, a U.S. patented NFC-enabled technology (Patent No. 11,301,649 B2) that turns an ordinary patch or keychain into a digital experience.</p>
                    <p class="desc">Tap your phone, and — boom — you’re instantly connected to videos, websites, promotions, or loyalty programs. It’s like giving your brand a pulse, right there on the patch.</p>
                    <p class="desc">SmartPatch® perfectly sums up Rich’s career: hands-on craftsmanship meets forward-thinking innovation — with a wink and a grin.</p>
