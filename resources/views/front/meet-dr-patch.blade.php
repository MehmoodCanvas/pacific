                    <p class="desc">(U.S. Patent No. 11,301,649 B2 – SmartPatch® Technology)</p>
                    <p class="desc">If it can be stitched, molded, printed, or patented, chances are Rich Soergel has already done it — probably twice, and with better colors.</p>
                    <p class="desc">Back in 1984, Rich bought a small design studio called Morris Designs, armed with nothing more than determination, creativity, and a coffee-fueled dream. A year later, he transformed it into Pacific Sportswear & Emblem Company — the spark that would ignite nearly four decades of innovation, design, and laughter (because anyone who’s worked with Rich knows there’s always some laughter).</p>

                    <p class="desc">Rich’s big break came with the America’s Cup, where he produced official headwear and emblems for some of the most elite teams on the water. Those early projects were crafted the old-school way — by hand, with precision, pride, and maybe a few late nights fueled by bad pizza and good ideas.</p>
                    <p class="desc">The results spoke for themselves: Pacific Sportswear was suddenly on the global stage, and Rich learned that a good patch can make waves — literally.</p>
